# Team 6: Sugar
> Ananya, Christine, Van

Choose a drink --tea or coffee-- to get started! You will need to guide the sugar down into the coffee or tea by drawing lines through mouse clicks - who wants a drink without sugar. When a drink asks for brown sugar, make sure to pass the sugar through the brown color change converter platform to change white sugar to brown :)

# Team 8: Piano Tiles by MET
> Erick, Melanie, Temi

Our program is a piano simulator with tiles falling down for a sample song we hardcoded in. We used the WebMidi API to allow the user to be able to connect their own piano keyboard (midi) and have the program, in real-time, show what key is being pressed. We hope to expand our project to let the user import their own midi files to practice along to.
